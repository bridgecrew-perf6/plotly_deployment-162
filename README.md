# Overview

In this repository, we utilize the Plotly library to create 3 charts with JavaScript to display data collected from numerous subjects to observe the correlation between belly button washing and the bacteria collected. This information is organized into a Bar Chart, Bubble Chart, and Gauge Chart. Once the script was written to create the charts, the index.html file was written using the Bootstrap 3 CSS framework to add styling and organize the charts onto a web page. With the D3 JS library to handle events on the page, a user can select the subject ID from a dropdown menu to view the data from the individual that was collected. This includes the subject's demogrpahic information, belly button washing frequency, and bacterial samples that were collected. Finally, the project was published to GitHub Pages to allow this information to be viewed publicly. 

# Results

A dropdown menu is available on the left side of the page that allows the user to select the Test Subject ID to different samples.
